This README contains descriptions for Memory Allocation Exercises
The 0-create_array.c creates an array of chars and initializes with specific char
The 1-strdup.creturns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
The 2-str_concat.c concatenates two strings.
The 3-alloc_grid.c returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
The 4-free_grid.c frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
